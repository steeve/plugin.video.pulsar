            Classmethod aimed to create flavoured instances of BaseHandler.
            When you create a new connection you may want to give the constructor
            a set of specific arguments. Use this classmethod to do that:

                conn = bjsonrpc.connect(handler_factory=MyHandler._factory("my flavoured one"))

            Later, whenever the class is instantiated, the BaseHandler.setup
            method will receive the arguments passed to factory.

            The original idea for this feature is from Paul Pietkiewicz *(pawel.pietkiewicz (at) gmail.com)*
